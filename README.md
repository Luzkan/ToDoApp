# Yours Todo's
Todo App written in Kotlin for Android


## About 
It's my fourth project. This time the task was to build simple Todo app that uses EditText and Button and proper layout.
Additionaly user should be able to delete a task and app should remember added tasks on screen rotation. 
Disclaimer: For extra points - more functionality the better.


## App Featuring
So besides what was necessery for max points I decided to:
* Implement whole database to the project to save those todo's when user quits the app (so it's actually any useful)
* UI saves state after screen rotation and app closure
* Add priorities with colors and icon based on Title
* Edition of tasks
* Sorting (on date added / dated to do / title / priority)
* Descriptions to the tasks
* Quick Add
* Custom app colors and icon
